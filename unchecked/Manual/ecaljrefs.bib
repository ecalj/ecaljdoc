The method is unique compared with other mixed-basis methods in that we simultaneously use two kinds of augmented waves as bases in the framework of the linearized method: the augmented plane waves ({APWs}) and the muffin-tin orbitals ({MTOs}). These two bases are responsible for the efficient representation of extended nature and localized nature of wavefunctions. We use a new simple prescription to determine parameters of {MTOs}. Owing to the inclusion of the {MTOs}, we can attain the convergence of chemical accuracy only with a very small number of {APWs} (cutoff energy of {APWs} is typically similar to 4 Ry).},

Sci. 542 177). From surface free energy calculations, a phase diagram is constructed indicating the range of conditions over which each structure is most stable. These results are compared with Kubo and Nozoye's experimental observations. It is concluded that low Sr adatom coverage structures can only be explained if the surface is far from equilibrium. Intermediate coverage structures are stable only if the surface is in or very nearly in equilibrium with the strontium oxide.}

We call this {PMT}-{QSGW}. Because of the two types of augmented bases, we have an efficient description of one-particle eigenfunctions in materials with a small number of basis functions. In {QSGW}, we have to treat a static nonlocal exchange-correlation potential, which is generated from the self-energy. We expand the potential in the highly localized {MTOs}. This allows us to carry out stable interpolation of the self-energy in the whole Brillouin zone. In addition, we have improved the offset-Gamma method for the Brillouin zone integration, so that we take into account the anisotropy of the screened Coulomb interaction in the calculation of the self-energy. For {GaAs} and cubic {SiO}2, we checked the convergence of calculated band gaps on cutoff parameters. {PMT}-{QSGW} is implemented in a first-principles electronic structure package ecalj, which is freely available from github.},

Excitation spectrum is also determined within the same formalism in a unified way. The diagrammatic evaluation is most conveniently done by using auxiliary field method. Several generalizations of the formalism and extension to the case other than the density operator are also discussed.},

In this method, we use an exchange-correlation energy which consists of the exact exchange (EXX) energy and the correlation energy in the random-phase approximation (RPA). A static approximation is used in the evaluation of the functional derivative of the RPA correlation energy. The self-consistent results for solid Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Si, and MnO (type-II antiferromagnets) are presented. For the transition metals Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni, it is shown that the correlation potential gives rise to a large contribution which has the opposite sign to the exchange potential. The resulting eigenvalue dispersions and the magnetic moments are very close to those of the LDA and experiments. On the other hand, the Fermi-contact parts of the hyperfine field are rather different from the LDA results, and are in better agreement with experiments. The band gap obtained for Si is larger than the LDA value by . For MnO, the density of states shows good correspondence with data obtained by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy.},

In these equations the exchange and correlation portions of the chemical potential of a uniform electron gas appear as additional effective potentials. \{(The\} exchange portion of our effective potential differs from that due to Slater by a factor of 2 / 3.)

The derived Debye-Waller factor for the valence electrons, D(G), is given by a linear combination of the self-correlation and nearest-neighbor-pair correlation parameters of the ion displacement. The calculated values for Si(222) above room temperature are about 88\% of the Debye-Waller factor for the core electrons, D(c)(G), in good agreement with experiment within experimental uncertainties.},

abstract = {A method for estimating the grain-size and grain-aspect-ratio distributions in polycrystalline sintered bodies has been developed. We assume that grains are ellipsoids specified by three radii and that the radii distribution obeys to a probability-distribution function expressed with four distribution parameters. As a function of the four parameters, the area and the aspect-ratio histograms of the grain cross-sections of a sintered-body cross-section can be calculated by a Monte Carlo simulation method. The distribution parameter values are determined so that the calculated histograms conform to the observed ones by iterative calculation. We apply this analysis to the observed histograms about two kinds of alumina, obtained by using an image analyzer. The calculated histograms agree with the observed ones fairly well.},

abstract = {We have developed a quasiparticle self-consistent GW method (QSGW), which is a new self- consistent method to calculate the electronic structure within the GW approximation. The method is formulated based on the idea of a self- consistent perturbation; the non- interacting Green function G0, which is the starting point for GWA to obtain G, is determined self- consistently so as to minimize the perturbative correction generated by GWA. After selfconsistency is attained, we have G(0), W ( the screened Coulomb interaction) and G self- consistently. This G(0) can be interpreted as the optimum non- interacting propagator for the quasiparticles.   We will summarize some theoretical discussions to justify QSGW. Then we will survey results which have been obtained up to now: e. g., band gaps for normal semiconductors are predicted to a precision of 0.1-0.3 eV; the selfconsistency including the off- diagonal part is required for NiO and MnO; and so on. There are still some remaining disagreements with experiments; however, they are very systematic, and can be explained from the neglect of excitonic effects.},

abstract = {Most metals are oxidized under ambient conditions, and metal oxides show interesting and technologically promising properties. This has motivated much recent research on oxide surfaces. The combination of scanning tunneling microscopy with first-principles density functional theory-based computational techniques provides an atomic-scale view of the properties of metal-oxide materials. Surface polarity is a key concept for predicting the stability of oxide surfaces and is discussed using ZnO as an example. This review also highlights the role of surface defects for surface reactivity, and their interplay with defects in the bulk, for the case of TiO(2). Ultrathin metal-oxide films, grown either through reactive evaporation on metal single crystals or through oxidation of metal alloys (such as Al(2)O(3)/NiAl), have gained popularity as supports for planar model catalysts. The surface oxides that form upon oxidation on Pt-group metals (e.g., Ru, Rh, Pd, and Pt) are considered as model systems for CO oxidation.},

We obtain GW quasiparticle energies starting from density-functional theory (DFT) calculations including Hubbard U corrections. Using a simple iterative procedure we determine the value of the Hubbard parameter yielding a vanishing quasiparticle correction to the fundamental bandgap of anatase TiO(2). The bandgap (3.3 eV) calculated using this optimal Hubbard parameter is smaller than the value obtained by applying many-body perturbation theory to standard DFT eigenstates and eigenvalues (3.7 eV). We extend our analysis to the rutile polymorph of TiO(2) and reach similar conclusions.

The two kinds of samples fabricated by co-evaporation had extremely different conversion efficiencies of 10\% and 0.2\% for stoichiometric and Cu- and Se-deficient compositions, respectively. We examined the microscopic reasons for the differences in the local electrical properties. Current mapping and current–voltage behaviors were measured at intragrain regions (IGs) and grain boundaries (GBs). Electronic transport between a Pt scanning probe and the CIGS layer is explained by the Schottky conduction mechanism. The surface potential distribution shows an intriguing relation with topological variation, inferring that a local built-in potential is possibly formed on positively charged GBs. The surface potential is about 100 mV, which shows energy band bending near GBs in the films. Exciton separation near GBs is explained by the bending of the conduction and valence bands, which is sensitive to compositional and structural inhomogeneities.},

abstract = {We present an efficient scheme for calculating the Kohn-Sham ground state of metallic systems using pseudopotentials and a plane-wave basis set. In the first part the application of Pulay’s DIIS method \~{}direct inversion in the iterative subspace! to the iterative diagonalization of large matrices will be discussed. Our approach is stable, reliable, and minimizes the number of order Natoms 3 operations. In the second part, we will discuss an efficient mixing scheme also based on Pulay’s scheme. A special ‘‘metric’’ and a special ‘‘preconditioning’’ optimized for a plane-wave basis set will be introduced. Scaling of the method will be discussed in detail for non-self-consistent and self-consistent calculations. It will be shown that the number of iterations required to obtain a specific precision is almost independent of the system size. Altogether an order Natoms 2 scaling is found for systems containing up to 1000 electrons. If we take into account that the number of k points can be decreased linearly with the system size, the overall scaling can approach Natoms . We have implemented these algorithms within a powerful package called VASP \~{}Vienna ab initio simulation package!. The program and the techniques have been used successfully for a large number of different systems \~{}liquid and amorphous semiconductors, liquid simple and transition metals, metallic and semiconducting surfaces, phonons in simple metals, transition metals, and semiconductors! and turned out to be very reliable.},

abstract = {We present an all-electron implementation of the GW approximation and apply it to wurtzite ZnO. Eigenfunctions computed in the local-density approximation (LDA) by the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave or the linearized muffin-tin-orbital method supply the input for generating the Green function G and the screened Coulomb interaction W. A mixed basis is used for the expansion of W, consisting of plane waves in the interstitial region and augmented-wave-function products in the augmentation-sphere regions. The frequency dependence of the dielectric function is computed within the random-phase approximation (RPA), without a plasmon-pole approximation. The Zn 3d orbitals are treated as valence states within the LDA; both core and valence states are included in the self-energy calculation. The calculated band gap is smaller than experiment by similar to1 eV, in contrast to previously reported GW results. Self-energy corrections are orbital dependent and push down the deep O 2s and Zn 3d levels by similar to1 eV relative to the LDA. The d level shifts closer to experiment but the size of shift is underestimated, suggesting that the RPA overscreens localized states.},

Intermediate coverage structures are stable only if the surface is in or very nearly in equilibrium with the strontium oxide.},

Here we present an approach which we call the quasiparticle self-consistent GW approximation. It is based on a kind of self-consistent perturbation theory, where the self-consistency is constructed to minimize the perturbation. We apply it to selections from different classes of materials, including alkali metals, semiconductors, wide band gap insulators, transition metals, transition metal oxides, magnetic insulators, and rare earth compounds. Apart from some mild exceptions, the properties are very well described, particularly in weakly correlated cases. Self-consistency dramatically improves agreement with experiment, and is sometimes essential. Discrepancies with experiment are systematic, and can be explained in terms of approximations made.},

abstract = {Graphene sheets--one-atom-thick two-dimensional layers of sp2-bonded carbon--are predicted to have a range of unusual properties. Their thermal conductivity and mechanical stiffness may rival the remarkable in-plane values for graphite (approximately 3,000 W m(-1) K(-1) and 1,060 GPa, respectively); their fracture strength should be comparable to that of carbon nanotubes for similar types of defects; and recent studies have shown that individual graphene sheets have extraordinary electronic transport properties. One possible route to harnessing these properties for applications would be to incorporate graphene sheets in a composite material. The manufacturing of such composites requires not only that graphene sheets be produced on a sufficient scale but that they also be incorporated, and homogeneously distributed, into various matrices. Graphite, inexpensive and available in large quantity, unfortunately does not readily exfoliate to yield individual graphene sheets. Here we present a general approach for the preparation of graphene-polymer composites via complete exfoliation of graphite and molecular-level dispersion of individual, chemically modified graphene sheets within polymer hosts. A polystyrene-graphene composite formed by this route exhibits a percolation threshold of approximately 0.1 volume per cent for room-temperature electrical conductivity, the lowest reported value for any carbon-based composite except for those involving carbon nanotubes; at only 1 volume per cent, this composite has a conductivity of approximately 0.1 S m(-1), sufficient for many electrical applications. Our bottom-up chemical approach of tuning the graphene sheet properties provides a path to a broad new class of graphene-based materials and their use in a variety of applications.},

No joint destruction was observed. The tumor consisted of round and spindle cells arranged in a compact sheet. There were occasional slit-like spaces or lumina, and areas rich in collagen fibers giving an appearance of tendon tissues. Neoplastic cells gave a positive immunoreaction to vimentin, but negative reactions to antibodies against S-100 protein, cytokeratin and myoglobin. Based on these findings, this tumor was diagnosed as a synovial sarcoma generating from the tendon and tendon sheath, which is very uncommon in dogs.},

The QSGW predicts it as a fully polarized half-metallic ferromagnet for a wide range of x and lattice constant. Calculated density of states and dielectric functions are consistent with experiments. In contrast, the energies of the calculated spin wave are very low in comparison with experiments. This is affected neither by rhombohedral deformation nor the intrinsic deficiency in the QSGW method. Thus we end up with a conjecture that phonons related to the Jahn-Teller distortion should hybridize with spin waves more strongly than people thought until now.},

To achieve an insulating gap Eg\{$\backslash$textgreater\}0 critical for \{TI\} applications, one often needs to resort to structural manipulations such as structural symmetry lowering (e.g., \{Bi2Se3)\}, strain, or quantum confinement. However, these methods have thus far opened an insulating gap of only \{$\backslash$textless\}0.1 \{eV.\} Here we point out that there is an electronic rather than structural way to affect an insulating gap in a \{TI:\} if one can invert the spin-orbit levels and place $\Gamma$8v below $\Gamma$7v (“negative spin-orbit splitting”), one can realize band inversion ($\Delta$i\{$\backslash$textless\}0) with a large insulating gap \{(Eg\} up to 0.5 \{eV).\} We outline design principles to create negative spin-orbit splitting: hybridization of d orbitals into p-like states. This general principle is illustrated in the “filled tetrahedral structures” \{(FTS)\} demonstrating via \{GW\} and density functional theory \{(DFT)\} calculations Eg\{$\backslash$textgreater\}0 with $\Delta$i\{$\backslash$textless\}0, albeit in a metastable form of \{FTS.\}},

The spin-orbit interaction is taken into account as a perturbation to the scalar relativistic Hamiltonian. These are the calculations of conduction-band spin splitting under deformation based on a quasiparticle approach and, because the self-consistent GW scheme accurately reproduces the relevant band parameters, it is expected to be a reliable predictor of spin splittings. We also discuss the spin-relaxation time under [110] strain and show that it exhibits an in-plane anisotropy, which can be exploited to obtain the magnitude and sign of the conduction-band spin splitting experimentally.},

abstract = {Problems associated with large-scale pattern growth of graphene constitute one of the main obstacles to using this material in device applications. Recently, macroscopic-scale graphene films were prepared by two-dimensional assembly of graphene sheets chemically derived from graphite crystals and graphene oxides. However, the sheet resistance of these films was found to be much larger than theoretically expected values. Here we report the direct synthesis of large-scale graphene films using chemical vapour deposition on thin nickel layers, and present two different methods of patterning the films and transferring them to arbitrary substrates. The transferred graphene films show very low sheet resistance of approximately 280 Omega per square, with approximately 80 per cent optical transparency. At low temperatures, the monolayers transferred to silicon dioxide substrates show electron mobility greater than 3,700 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, implying that the quality of graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition is as high as mechanically cleaved graphene. Employing the outstanding mechanical properties of graphene, we also demonstrate the macroscopic use of these highly conducting and transparent electrodes in flexible, stretchable, foldable electronics.},

abstract = {The pressure variation in the structural parameters, u and c/a, of the delafossite CuAlO2 is calculated within the local-density approximation (LDA). Further, the electronic structures as obtained by different approximations are compared: LDA, LDA+U, and a recently developed "quasiparticle self-consistent GW" (QSGW) approximation. The structural parameters obtained by the LDA agree very well with experiments but, as expected, gaps in the formal band structure are underestimated as compared to optical experiments. The (in LDA too high lying) Cu 3d states can be down shifted by LDA+U. The magnitude of the electric field gradient (EFG) as obtained within the LDA is far too small. It can be "fitted" to experiments in LDA+U but a simultaneous adjustment of the EFG and the gap cannot be obtained with a single U value. QSGW yields reasonable values for both quantities. LDA and QSGW yield significantly different values for some of the band-gap deformation potentials but calculations within both approximations predict that 3R-CuAlO2 remains an indirect-gap semiconductor at all pressures in its stability range 0-36 GPa, although the smallest direct gap has a negative pressure coefficient.},

abstract = {The challenges for further development of Li rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles are reviewed. Most important is safety, which requires development of a nonflammable electrolyte with either a larger window between its lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) and highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or a constituent (or additive) that can develop rapidly a solid/electrolyte-interface (SEI) layer to prevent plating of Li on a carbon anode during a fast charge of the battery. A high Li(+)-ion conductivity (sigma(Li) > 10(-4) S/cm) in the electrolyte and across the electrode/ electrolyte interface is needed for a power battery. Important also is ail increase in the density of the stored energy, which is the product of the voltage and capacity of reversible Li insertion/extraction into/from the electrodes. It will be difficult to design a better anode than carbon, but carbon requires formation of an SEI layer, which involves an irreversible capacity loss. The design of a cathode composed of environmentally benign, low-cost materials that has its electrochemical potential pc well-matched to the HOMO of the electrolyte and allows access to two Li atoms per transition-metal cation would increase the energy density, but it is a daunting challenge. Two redox couples can be accessed where the cation redox couples are "pinned" at the top of the 0 2p bands, but to take advantage of this possibility, it must be realized in a framework structure that can accept more than one Li atom per transition-metal cation, Moreover, such a situation represents an intrinsic voltage limit of the cathode, and matching this limit to the HOMO of the electrolyte requires the ability to tune the intrinsic voltage limit. Finally, the chemical compatibility in the battery must allow a long service life.},

abstract = {We report on experimental results on band gap and lattice distortion in CuInSe2 for various degrees of Cu deficiency. The band gap is measured by optical methods, and the Cu vacancy density and anion displacement parameter are determined by neutron scattering. Our data show that the band gap decreases for Cu-poor compositions, and the anion displacement is weakly dependent on the concentration of Cu vacancies. This is in apparent contradiction with ab initio calculations that always predict a larger band gap in presence of Cu vacancies. To shed light on this issue, we studied the overall dependence of the band gap on the anion displacement and on the concentration of Cu vacancies using a self-consistent GW approach and hybrid functionals, including a feedback mechanism that was recently proposed. Our calculations illustrate consistently the remarkable stability of the band gap of chalcopyrite semiconductors and explain the experimental observations by a coupled effect of Cu vacancies and lattice distortions within the feedback model.},

Self-consistency systematically improves ionization energies and total energies of closed-shell systems compared to G0W0 based on Hartree-Fock and (semi)local density-functional theory. These improvements also translate to the electron density, as exemplified by an improved description of dipole moments, and permit us to assess the quality of ground-state properties such as bond lengths and vibrational frequencies.},

abstract = {We present recent advances in numerical implementations of hybrid functionals and the GW approximation within the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (FLAPW) method. The former is an approximation for the exchange–correlation contribution to the total energy functional in density-functional theory, and the latter is an approximation for the electronic self-energy in the framework of many-body perturbation theory. All implementations employ the mixed product basis, which has evolved into a versatile basis for the products of wave functions, describing the incoming and outgoing states of an electron that is scattered by interacting with another electron. It can thus be used for representing the nonlocal potential in hybrid functionals as well as the screened interaction and related quantities in GW calculations. In particular, the six-dimensional space integrals of the Hamiltonian exchange matrix elements (and exchange self-energy) decompose into sums over vector–matrix–vector products, which can be evaluated easily. The correlation part of the GW self-energy, which contains a time or frequency dependence, is calculated on the imaginary frequency axis with a subsequent analytic continuation to the real axis or, alternatively, by a direct frequency convolution of the Green function G and the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W along a contour integration path that avoids the poles of the Green function. Hybrid-functional and GW calculations are notoriously computationally expensive. We present a number of tricks that reduce the computational cost considerably, including the use of spatial and time-reversal symmetries, modifications of the mixed product basis with the aim to optimize it for the correlation self-energy and another modification that makes the Coulomb matrix sparse, analytic expansions of the interaction potentials around the point of divergence at k = 0, and a nested density and density-matrix convergence scheme for hybrid-functional calculations. We show CPU timings for prototype semiconductors and illustrative results for GdN and ZnO.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the influence of the basis set on the GW self-energy correction in the full-potential linearized augmented-plane-wave (LAPW) approach and similar linearized all-electron methods. A systematic improvement is achieved by including local orbitals that are defined as second and higher energy derivatives of solutions to the radial scalar-relativistic Dirac equation and thus constitute a natural extension of the LAPW basis set. Within this approach linearization errors can be eliminated, and the basis set becomes complete. While the exchange contribution to the self-energy is little affected by the increased basis-set flexibility, the correlation contribution benefits from the better description of the unoccupied states, as do the quasiparticle energies. The resulting band gaps remain relatively unaffected, however; for Si we find an increase of 0.03 eV.},

abstract = {Excited-state calculations, notably for quasiparticle band structures, are nowadays routinely performed within the GW approximation for the electronic self-energy. Nevertheless, certain numerical approximations and simplifications are still employed in practice to make the computations feasible. An important aspect for periodic systems is the proper treatment of the singularity of the screened Coulomb interaction in reciprocal space, which results from the slow 1 / r decay in real space. This must be done without introducing artificial interactions between the quasiparticles and their periodic images in repeated cells, which occur when integrals of the screened Coulomb interaction are discretised in reciprocal space. An adequate treatment of both aspects is crucial for a numerically stable computation of the self-energy. In this article we build on existing schemes for isotropic screening and present an extension for anisotropic systems. We also show how the contributions to the dielectric function arising from the non-local part of the pseudopotentials can be computed efficiently. These improvements are crucial for obtaining a fast convergence with respect to the number of points used for the Brillouin zone integration and prove to be essential to make GW calculations for strongly anisotropic systems, such as slabs or multilayers, efficient.},

This paper discusses a new set of special functions which combine many of the advantageous features of both families. At large distances from the origin, these “smoothed Hankel functions” resemble the standard Hankel functions and therefore show behavior similar to that of an electronic wave function. Near the origin, the functions are smooth and analytical. Analytical expressions are derived for two-center integrals for the overlap, the kinetic energy, and the electrostatic energy between two such functions. We also show how to expand such a function around some point in space and discuss how to evaluate the potential matrix elements efficiently by numerical integration. This supplies the elements needed for a practical application in an electronic structure calculation. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

A surprisingly simple band structure emerges which indicates that this system may be regarded as a "supercrystal," where each cluster of guest atoms with diameter similar to10 Angstrom acts as a "superatom" with well-defined s- and p-like orbitals, which in turn form tight-binding bands around the Fermi energy. The calculated Coulomb energy for these states turns out to be in the strongly correlated regime.

We apply the method to Si, Ge, GaAs, InSb, and diamond and show that the band gaps of these materials universally decrease with increasing temperature in contrast with results of the local density approximation (LDA) of density functional theory where the band gaps universally increase. At temperatures of a few eV the difference between quasiparticle energies obtained in FT QPSCGW and FT LDA approaches is significantly reduced. This result suggests that existing simulations of very high-temperature materials based on the FT LDA are more justified than it might appear from the well-known LDA band gap errors at zero temperature.},

abstract = {We have developed a quasiparticle self-consistent GW method (QSGW), which is a new self- consistent method to calculate the electronic structure within the GW approximation. The method is formulated based on the idea of a self- consistent perturbation; the non- interacting Green function G0, which is the starting point for GWA to obtain G, is determined self- consistently so as to minimize the perturbative correction generated by GWA. After selfconsistency is attained, we have G(0), W ( the screened Coulomb interaction) and G self- consistently. This G(0) can be interpreted as the optimum non- interacting propagator for the quasiparticles.   We will summarize some theoretical discussions to justify QSGW. Then we will survey results which have been obtained up to now: e. g., band gaps for normal semiconductors are predicted to a precision of 0.1-0.3 eV; the selfconsistency including the off- diagonal part is required for NiO and MnO; and so on. There are still some remaining disagreements with experiments; however, they are very systematic, and can be explained from the neglect of excitonic effects.},

abstract = {We describe a complete set of algorithms for ab initio molecular simulations based on numerically tabulated atom-centered orbitals (NAOs) to capture a wide range of molecular and materials properties from quantum-mechanical first principles. The full algorithmic framework described here is embodied in the Fritz Haber Institute “ab initio molecular simulations” (FHI-aims) computer program package. Its comprehensive description should be relevant to any other first-principles implementation based on NAOs. The focus here is on density-functional theory (DFT) in the local and semilocal (generalized gradient) approximations, but an extension to hybrid functionals, Hartree–Fock theory, and MP2/GW electron self-energies for total energies and excited states is possible within the same underlying algorithms. An all-electron/full-potential treatment that is both computationally efficient and accurate is achieved for periodic and cluster geometries on equal footing, including relaxation and ab initio molecular dynamics. We demonstrate the construction of transferable, hierarchical basis sets, allowing the calculation to range from qualitative tight-binding like accuracy to meV-level total energy convergence with the basis set. Since all basis functions are strictly localized, the otherwise computationally dominant grid-based operations scale as O(N) with system size N. Together with a scalar-relativistic treatment, the basis sets provide access to all elements from light to heavy. Both low-communication parallelization of all real-space grid based algorithms and a ScaLapack-based, customized handling of the linear algebra for all matrix operations are possible, guaranteeing efficient scaling (CPU time and memory) up to massively parallel computer systems with thousands of CPUs.},

abstract = {Using linear-response density-functional theory, we obtain the magnetic interactions in several iron pnictides. The ground state has been found to be non-collinear in FeSe, with a large continuum of nearly degenerate states lying very close to the magnetic 'striped' structure. The presence of non-collinearity also seems to be a generic feature of iron pnictides when the Fe moment is small. At small R(Fe-Se) the system is itinerant: strong frustration gives rise to an excess of spin entropy, long ranged interactions create incommensurate orderings and strong biquadratic coupling violates the applicability of the Heisenberg model. There is a smooth transition to more localized behavior as R(Fe-Se) increases: stable magnetic orbital order develops which favors long range AFM stripe ordering with strongly anisotropic in-plane exchange couplings. The stabilization of the stripe magnetic order is accompanied by the inversion of the exchange coupling.},

This contrasts with the observed stability of the band gap of \{CIS\} solar panels under operating conditions, where a relatively large dispersion of values for u occurs. We solve this apparent paradox considering the coupled effect on the band gap of copper vacancies and lattice distortions.

abstract = {In a cubic topological insulator (TI), there is a band inversion whereby the s-like $\Gamma$6c conduction band is below the p-like $\Gamma$7v+$\Gamma$8v valence bands by the “inversion energy” $\Delta$i<0. In TIs based on the zinc-blende structure such as HgTe, the Fermi energy intersects the degenerate $\Gamma$8v state so the insulating gap Eg between occupied and unoccupied bands vanishes. To achieve an insulating gap Eg>0 critical for TI applications, one often needs to resort to structural manipulations such as structural symmetry lowering (e.g., Bi2Se3), strain, or quantum confinement. However, these methods have thus far opened an insulating gap of only <0.1 eV. Here we point out that there is an electronic rather than structural way to affect an insulating gap in a TI: if one can invert the spin-orbit levels and place $\Gamma$8v below $\Gamma$7v (“negative spin-orbit splitting”), one can realize band inversion ($\Delta$i<0) with a large insulating gap (Eg up to 0.5 eV). We outline design principles to create negative spin-orbit splitting: hybridization of d orbitals into p-like states. This general principle is illustrated in the “filled tetrahedral structures” (FTS) demonstrating via GW and density functional theory (DFT) calculations Eg>0 with $\Delta$i<0, albeit in a metastable form of FTS.},

abstract = {We present a new kind of self-consistent GW approximation based on the all-electron, full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital method. By iterating the eigenfunctions of the GW Hamiltonian, self-consistency in both the charge density and the quasiparticle spectrum is achieved. We explain why this form of self-consistency should be preferred to the conventional one. Some results for Si (a representative semiconductor) are presented. Finally we consider many details in the electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic insulators MnO and NiO. Excellent agreement with experiment is shown for many properties, suggesting that a Landau quasiparticle (energy band) picture provides a reasonable description of electronic structure even in these correlated materials.},

abstract = {We present a new density-functional method which does not exploit the local density approximation (LDA). In this method, we use an exchange-correlation energy which consists of the exact exchange (EXX) energy and the correlation energy in the random-phase approximation (RPA). A static approximation is used in the evaluation of the functional derivative of the RPA correlation energy. The self-consistent results for solid Cu, Fe, Co, Ni, Si, and MnO (type-II antiferromagnets) are presented. For the transition metals Cu, Fe, Co, and Ni, it is shown that the correlation potential gives rise to a large contribution which has the opposite sign to the exchange potential. The resulting eigenvalue dispersions and the magnetic moments are very close to those of the LDA and experiments. On the other hand, the Fermi-contact parts of the hyperfine field are rather different from the LDA results, and are in better agreement with experiments. The band gap obtained for Si is larger than the LDA value by similar to 0.2 eV. For MnO, the density of states shows good correspondence with data obtained by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and bremsstrahlung isochromat spectroscopy.},

The spin-orbit interaction is taken into account as a perturbation to the scalar relativistic Hamiltonian. These are the first calculations of conduction band spin splittings based on a quasiparticle approach; and because the self-consistent GW scheme accurately reproduces the relevant band parameters, it is expected to be a reliable predictor of spin splittings. The results are compared to the few available experimental data and a previous calculation based on a model one-particle potential. We also briefly address the widely used k center dot p parametrization in the context of these results.},

abstract = {Graphene is the two-dimensional building block for carbon allotropes of every other dimensionality. We show that its electronic structure is captured in its Raman spectrum that clearly evolves with the number of layers. The D peak second order changes in shape, width, and position for an increasing number of layers, reflecting the change in the electron bands via a double resonant Raman process. The G peak slightly down-shifts. This allows unambiguous, high-throughput, nondestructive identification of graphene layers, which is critically lacking in this emerging research area.},

abstract = {Much controversy is aroused in the electronic structure of hexaborides both in theories and experiments. In order to settle this problem, the quasiparticle energies are calculated including the effects of electron correlations beyond the local density approximation in the stoichiometric calcium hexaborides. It is shown that electron correlation does not open the band gap, contrary to the naive expectation. This semimetallic band structure coincides with the magnetic oscillation measurements, and the origin of this abnormal quasiparticle shifts is elucidated as being closely connected with the details of the wavefunctions in the non-local interaction terms.

abstract = {We have developed a quasiparticle self-consistent GW method (QSGW), which is a new self- consistent method to calculate the electronic structure within the GW approximation. The method is formulated based on the idea of a self- consistent perturbation; the non- interacting Green function G0, which is the starting point for GWA to obtain G, is determined self- consistently so as to minimize the perturbative correction generated by GWA. After selfconsistency is attained, we have G(0), W ( the screened Coulomb interaction) and G self- consistently. This G(0) can be interpreted as the optimum non- interacting propagator for the quasiparticles.   We will summarize some theoretical discussions to justify QSGW. Then we will survey results which have been obtained up to now: e. g., band gaps for normal semiconductors are predicted to a precision of 0.1-0.3 eV; the selfconsistency including the off- diagonal part is required for NiO and MnO; and so on. There are still some remaining disagreements with experiments; however, they are very systematic, and can be explained from the neglect of excitonic effects.},

abstract = {We present calculations of spin wave dispersions for antiferromagnetic MnO, NiO and ferromagnetic alpha-MnAs based on the recently developed quasiparticle self-consistent GW method (QSGW); we have already shown that QSGW gave a good quasiparticle picture for MnO and NiO in comparison with optical experiments. To obtain the spin wave dispersions, we have developed a method to calculate the transverse dynamical spin susceptibility in the random-phase approximation. This is a general method applicable not only to QSGW, but also to any first-principle method which gives the non-interacting (one-body) Hamiltonian to represent quasiparticles, e. g. the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian in the density functional theory. In the method, we first calculate the non-interacting spin susceptibility from the supplied non-interacting Hamiltonian; then we obtain the spin susceptibility where the size of the effective interaction is determined so as to satisfy a sum rule. For MnO and NiO, the obtained spin wave dispersions show good agreement with experiments, in contrast to the cases in the local density approximation (LDA) and in the LDA + U. These results support our claim that the independent-particle picture is powerful enough even for materials like NiO and MnO classified to the Mott insulator, that is, the quasiparticle pictures by QSGW work well to describe their linear responses. For alpha-MnAs, we find a collinear ferromagnetic ground state in QSGW, while this phase is unstable in the LDA.},

We show that the quasiparticle Bloch wave functions from such GW calculations can be used within this Wannier framework. These Wannier functions can be used to interpolate the many-body band structure from the coarse mesh of Brillouin-zone points on which it is known from the initial calculation to the usual symmetry lines, and we demonstrate that this procedure is accurate and efficient for the self-consistent GW band structure. The resemblance of these Wannier functions to the bond orbitals discussed in the chemical community led us to expect differences between density-functional and many-body functions that could be qualitatively interpreted. However, the differences proved to be minimal in the cases studied. Detailed results are presented for SrTiO3 and solid argon.},

However, efforts to make transparent conducting films from graphene have been hampered by the lack of efficient methods for the synthesis, transfer and doping of graphene at the scale and quality required for applications. Here, we report the roll-to-roll production and wet-chemical doping of predominantly monolayer 30-inch graphene films grown by chemical vapour deposition onto flexible copper substrates. The films have sheet resistances as low as approximately 125 ohms square(-1) with 97.4\% optical transmittance, and exhibit the half-integer quantum Hall effect, indicating their high quality. We further use layer-by-layer stacking to fabricate a doped four-layer film and measure its sheet resistance at values as low as approximately 30 ohms square(-1) at approximately 90\% transparency, which is superior to commercial transparent electrodes such as indium tin oxides. Graphene electrodes were incorporated into a fully functional touch-screen panel device capable of withstanding high strain.},

abstract = {We use a recently developed self-consistent GW approximation to present systematic ab initio calculations of the conduction band spin splitting in III-V and II-VI zinc blende semiconductors. The spin-orbit interaction is taken into account as a perturbation to the scalar relativistic Hamiltonian. These are the first calculations of conduction band spin splittings based on a quasiparticle approach; and because the self-consistent GW scheme accurately reproduces the relevant band parameters, it is expected to be a reliable predictor of spin splittings. The results are compared to the few available experimental data and a previous calculation based on a model one-particle potential. We also briefly address the widely used k x p parametrization in the context of these results.},

It takes full account of the energy dependence of the radial functions, and hence, provides more accurate treatment in principle than our previous one based on the linearized muffin-tin orbital method [Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 2989 (1995)]. In this method, we treat C, Si, Ge, MgO, CaO, and MnO (Antiferrro-II), which were previously studied in the framework of the linear-muffin-tin orbital method with EXX. The results are basically in agreement with the old ones, though small differences produce non-negligible effects on the results. Some numerical paints as well as the strict formulation of KKK in the ASA are discussed.},

abstract = {Excitonic solar cells-including organic, hybrid organic-inorganic and dye-sensitized cells (DSCs)-are promising devices for inexpensive, large-scale solar energy conversion. The DSC is currently the most efficient and stable excitonic photocell. Central to this device is a thick nanoparticle film that provides a large surface area for the adsorption of light-harvesting molecules. However, nanoparticle DSCs rely on trap-limited diffusion for electron transport, a slow mechanism that can limit device efficiency, especially at longer wavelengths. Here we introduce a version of the dye-sensitized cell in which the traditional nanoparticle film is replaced by a dense array of oriented, crystalline ZnO nanowires. The nanowire anode is synthesized by mild aqueous chemistry and features a surface area up to one-fifth as large as a nanoparticle cell. The direct electrical pathways provided by the nanowires ensure the rapid collection of carriers generated throughout the device, and a full Sun efficiency of 1.5\% is demonstrated, limited primarily by the surface area of the nanowire array.},

The QSGW predicts it as a fully polarized half-metallic ferromagnet for a wide range of x and lattice constant. Calculated density of states and dielectric functions are consistent with experiments. In contrast, the energies of the calculated spin wave are very low in comparison with experiments. This is affected neither by rhombohedral deformation nor the intrinsic deficiency in the QSGW method. Thus we end up with a conjecture that phonons related to the Jahn-Teller distortion should hybridize with spin waves more strongly than people thought until now.},

abstract = {In past decades the scientific community has been looking for a reliable first-principles method to predict the electronic structure of solids with high accuracy. Here we present an approach which we call the quasiparticle self-consistent approximation. It is based on a kind of self-consistent perturbation theory, where the self-consistency is constructed to minimize the perturbation. We apply it to selections from different classes of materials, including alkali metals, semiconductors, wide band gap insulators, transition metals, transition metal oxides, magnetic insulators, and rare earth compounds. Apart from some mild exceptions, the properties are very well described, particularly in weakly correlated cases. Self-consistency dramatically improves agreement with experiment, and is sometimes essential. Discrepancies with experiment are systematic, and can be explained in terms of approximations made.},

abstract = {Ballistic conductance calculations on infinite one-atom zigzag chains of Co and Au, and multi-atom Au nanowires, were computed using the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism within the local-density approximation (LDA). In the cobalt case, the majority spin channel exhibits quantized conductance, but because of the close spacing of the d levels, the minority channel does not. The calculated conductance is somewhat larger than what is observed. We suggest that the discrepancy is an indication that the Landauer-B\"{u}ttiker formalism breaks down in this narrow d band material. In contrast, Au (which was determined not to be spin polarized) does show well-behaved quantization in the case of the infinite zigzag chain. By increasing the dimension of the cross section of the chain, we find that quantization is lost once the lateral dimensions of the wire exceed two or so atoms. Finally, we show that the zigzag chain of Au can have a Peierls instability, making the chain insulating.},

abstract = {The nonresonant tunneling regime for charge transfer across nanojunctions is critically dependent on the so-called $\beta$ parameter, governing the exponential decay of the current as the length of the junction increases. For periodic materials, this parameter can be theoretically evaluated by computing the complex band structure (CBS)—or evanescent states—of the material forming the tunneling junction. In this work we present the calculation of the CBS for organic polymers using a variety of computational schemes, including standard local, semilocal, and hybrid-exchange density functionals, and many-body perturbation theory within the GW approximation. We compare the description of localization and $\beta$ parameters among the adopted methods and with experimental data. We show that local and semilocal density functionals systematically underestimate the $\beta$ parameter, while hybrid-exchange schemes partially correct for this discrepancy, resulting in a much better agreement with GW calculations and experiments. Self-consistency effects and self-energy representation issues of the GW corrections are discussed together with the use of Wannier functions to interpolate the electronic band structure.},

@misc{Lukashev2007a,
abstract = {Electronic structure calculations are presented for Cu2-xS using the full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. In the simple cubic antifluorite structure, Cu2S is found to be semimetallic both in the local density approximation (LDA) and using the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method. This is because the Cu d bands comprising the valence band maximum are degenerate at the Gamma point and the fact that the Cu s band, which can be considered to be the lowest conduction band, lies slightly below it at Gamma. Small deviations from the ideal antifluorite positions for the Cu atoms, however, open a small gap between the Cu d valence and Cu s-like conduction bands because the symmetry breaking allows the Cu s and Cu d bands to hybridize. Supercell models are constructed for cubic and hexagonal chalcocite Cu2S as well as cubic digenite Cu1.8S by means of a weighted random number structure generating algorithm. This approach generates models with Wyckoff site occupancies adjusted to those obtained from experimental x-ray diffraction results and with the constraint that atoms should stay within reasonable distance from each other. The band structures of these models as well as of the low-chalcocite monoclinic structure (Cu96S48) are calculated in LDA with an additional Cu s shift obtained from the QSGW-LDA difference for the antifluorite structure. Even with this correction, smaller band gaps of about 0.4-0.6 eV (increasing from cubic to hexagonal to monoclinic) than experimentally observed (1.1-1.2 eV) are obtained for the Cu2S composition. Decreasing the Cu content of Cu2-xS in the range 0.06 < x < 0.2 is found to essentially dope the p-type material by placing the Fermi level 0.2-0.3 eV below the valence band maximum but also to increase the gap between highest partially filled valence band and lowest conduction bands to about 0.7-1.0 eV. This results from a reduced Cu d-band width. Thus, the optical band gap or onset of optical absorption increases in part but not exclusively due to the Moss-Burstein effect. The total energies of the structures are found to increase from monoclinic to hexagonal to cubic to antifluorite. This is consistent with the fact that the simple antifluorite structure is not observed and that the systems change from monoclinic to hexagonal to cubic with increasing temperature, under the assumption that the electronic energy of the system dominates the free energy. We find that Cu2S is unstable toward the formation of Cu vacancies even in thermodynamic equilibrium with bulk Cu metal. The experimental data on the band gaps and optical absorption are discussed. We find no evidence for indirect band gaps in the hexagonal materials and argue that the experimental results are consistent with this in spite of previous reports to the contrary. The presence of a second onset of absorption located about 0.5 eV higher than the minimum band gap observed in experiment is explained by a rise in conduction band density of states at this energy in our calculations. The calculated increase in gap with decreasing Cu concentration is in agreement with experimental observations.},

abstract = {We have developed a quasiparticle self-consistent GW method (QSGW), which is a new self-consistent method to calculate the electronic structure within the GW approximation. The method is formulated based on the idea of a self-consistent perturbation; the non-interacting Green function G(0), which is the starting point for GWA to obtain G, is determined self-consistently so as to minimize the perturbative correction generated by GWA. After self-consistency is attained, we have G(0), W (the screened Coulomb interaction) and G self-consistently. This G(0) can be interpreted as the optimum non-interacting propagator for the quasiparticles. We will summarize some theoretical discussions to justify QSGW. Then we will survey results which have been obtained up to now: e.g., band gaps for normal semiconductors are predicted to a precision of 0.1-0.3 eV; the self-consistency including the off-diagonal part is required for NiO and MnO; and so on. There are still some remaining disagreements with experiments; however, they are very systematic, and can be explained from the neglect of excitonic effects.},

The QSGW predicts it as a fully polarized half-metallic ferromagnet for a wide range of x and lattice constant. Calculated density of states and dielectric functions are consistent with experiments. In contrast, the energies of the calculated spin wave are very low in comparison with experiments. This is affected neither by rhombohedral deformation nor the intrinsic deficiency in the QSGW method.

This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

We apply the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method to the rare-earth metals Gd and Er and to the rare-earth monopnictides GdN, EuN, YbN, GdAs, and ErAs. QSGW is unique in that it automatically takes into account both spd and f electrons in a single, unified framework without any materials-dependent parameters or special treatment of the f electrons. It enables us to examine approximations behind the standard local density approximation+U and self-interaction corrected approaches. QSGW reproduces the experimental occupied 4f levels well, though the unoccupied levels are a little overestimated. Properties of the Fermi surface responsible for electronic properties-governed by the spd electrons-are in good agreement with available experimental data. GdN is predicted to be very near a critical point of a metal-insulator transition.},

abstract = {This paper reports the results of an investigation of the structure-property relationship of vanadium (donor) and scandium (acceptor) doped Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3, While V doping produces a fully miscible Ba0.7Sr0.3Ti1-xVxO3 alloy, Sc doping results in an inhomogeneous microstructure with grains containing a Sc-doped Ba-rich shell and an undoped Sr-rich core. This results from a solution-precipitation process that works in combination with a thermodynamic driving force for the preferential segregation of Sc into Ba-rich regions. The Curie temperature (T-c) of Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3 decreases with increasing dopant concentration from a T-c of 40 degrees C for undoped material to 18 degrees C for 4 mol.\% V and 22 degrees C for 4 mol.\% Sc (i.e., Ba0.7Sr0.3Ti0.96V0.04O3, Ba0.7Sr0.3Ti0.96Sc0.04O3). Sc- and V-doped materials are found to have significantly reduced dielectric constants at their Curie temperature than their undoped counterpart. This is most evident for Sc doping, where a 4 mol.\% concentration has a dielectric constant of 1000 at T-c, a factor of 12 times smaller than undoped Ba0.7Sr0.3TiO3.

abstract = {There is great interest in developing rechargeable lithium batteries with higher energy capacity and longer cycle life for applications in portable electronic devices, electric vehicles and implantable medical devices. Silicon is an attractive anode material for lithium batteries because it has a low discharge potential and the highest known theoretical charge capacity (4,200 mAh g(-1); ref. 2). Although this is more than ten times higher than existing graphite anodes and much larger than various nitride and oxide materials, silicon anodes have limited applications because silicon's volume changes by 400\% upon insertion and extraction of lithium which results in pulverization and capacity fading. Here, we show that silicon nanowire battery electrodes circumvent these issues as they can accommodate large strain without pulverization, provide good electronic contact and conduction, and display short lithium insertion distances. We achieved the theoretical charge capacity for silicon anodes and maintained a discharge capacity close to 75\% of this maximum, with little fading during cycling.},

abstract = {The pressure variation in the structural parameters, u and c/a, of the delafossite CuAlO2 is calculated within the local-density approximation (LDA). Further, the electronic structures as obtained by different approximations are compared: LDA, LDA+U, and a recently developed "quasiparticle self-consistent GW" (QSGW) approximation. The structural parameters obtained by the LDA agree very well with experiments but, as expected, gaps in the formal band structure are underestimated as compared to optical experiments. The (in LDA too high lying) Cu 3d states can be down shifted by LDA+U. The magnitude of the electric field gradient (EFG) as obtained within the LDA is far too small. It can be "fitted" to experiments in LDA+U but a simultaneous adjustment of the EFG and the gap cannot be obtained with a single U value. QSGW yields reasonable values for both quantities. LDA and QSGW yield significantly different values for some of the band-gap deformation potentials but calculations within both approximations predict that 3R-CuAlO2 remains an indirect-gap semiconductor at all pressures in its stability range 0-36 GPa, although the smallest direct gap has a negative pressure coefficient.},

abstract = {The nonresonant tunneling regime for charge transfer across nanojunctions is critically dependent on the so-called $\beta$ parameter, governing the exponential decay of the current as the length of the junction increases. For periodic materials, this parameter can be theoretically evaluated by computing the complex band structure \{(CBS)—or\} evanescent states—of the material forming the tunneling junction. In this work we present the calculation of the \{CBS\} for organic polymers using a variety of computational schemes, including standard local, semilocal, and hybrid-exchange density functionals, and many-body perturbation theory within the \{GW\} approximation. We compare the description of localization and $\beta$ parameters among the adopted methods and with experimental data. We show that local and semilocal density functionals systematically underestimate the $\beta$ parameter, while hybrid-exchange schemes partially correct for this discrepancy, resulting in a much better agreement with \{GW\} calculations and experiments. Self-consistency effects and self-energy representation issues of the \{GW\} corrections are discussed together with the use of Wannier functions to interpolate the electronic band structure.},

abstract = {We report on experimental results on band gap and lattice distortion in \{CuInSe2\} for various degrees of Cu deficiency. The band gap is measured by optical methods, and the Cu vacancy density and anion displacement parameter are determined by neutron scattering. Our data show that the band gap decreases for Cu-poor compositions, and the anion displacement is weakly dependent on the concentration of Cu vacancies. This is in apparent contradiction with ab initio calculations that always predict a larger band gap in presence of Cu vacancies. To shed light on this issue, we studied the overall dependence of the band gap on the anion displacement and on the concentration of Cu vacancies using a self-consistent \{GW\} approach and hybrid functionals, including a feedback mechanism that was recently proposed. Our calculations illustrate consistently the remarkable stability of the band gap of chalcopyrite semiconductors and explain the experimental observations by a coupled effect of Cu vacancies and lattice distortions within the feedback model.},

abstract = {The indentation load-displacement behavior of six materials tested with a Berkovich indenter has been carefully documented to establish an improved method for determining hardness and elastic modulus from indentation load-displacement data. The materials included fused silica, soda-lime glass, and single crystals of aluminum, tungsten, quartz, and sapphire. It is shown that the load-displacement curves during unloading in these materials are not linear, even in the initial stages, thereby suggesting that the flat punch approximation used so often in the analysis of unloading data is not entirely adequate. An analysis technique is presented that accounts for the curvature in the unloading data and provides a physically justifiable procedure for determining the depth which should be used in conjunction with the indenter shape function to establish the contact area at peak load. The hardnesses and elastic moduli of the six materials are computed using the analysis procedure and compared with values determined by independent means to assess the accuracy of the method. The results show that with good technique, moduli can be measured to within 5\%.},

abstract = {Electronic structure calculations are presented for Cu(2-x)S using the full-potential linearized muffin-tin orbital method. In the simple cubic antifluorite structure, Cu(2)S is found to be semimetallic both in the local density approximation (LDA) and using the quasiparticle self-consistent GW (QSGW) method. This is because the Cu d bands comprising the valence band maximum are degenerate at the Gamma point and the fact that the Cu s band, which can be considered to be the lowest conduction band, lies slightly below it at Gamma. Small deviations from the ideal antifluorite positions for the Cu atoms, however, open a small gap between the Cu d valence and Cu s-like conduction bands because the symmetry breaking allows the Cu s and Cu d bands to hybridize. Supercell models are constructed for cubic and hexagonal chalcocite Cu(2)S as well as cubic digenite Cu(1.8)S by means of a weighted random number structure generating algorithm. This approach generates models with Wyckoff site occupancies adjusted to those obtained from experimental x-ray diffraction results and with the constraint that atoms should stay within reasonable distance from each other. The band structures of these models as well as of the low-chalcocite monoclinic structure (Cu(96)S(48)) are calculated in LDA with an additional Cu s shift obtained from the QSGW-LDA difference for the antifluorite structure. Even with this correction, smaller band gaps of about 0.4-0.6 eV (increasing from cubic to hexagonal to monoclinic) than experimentally observed (1.1-1.2 eV) are obtained for the Cu(2)S composition. Decreasing the Cu content of Cu(2-x)S in the range 0.06 < x < 0.2 is found to essentially dope the p-type material by placing the Fermi level 0.2-0.3 eV below the valence band maximum but also to increase the gap between highest partially filled valence band and lowest conduction bands to about 0.7-1.0 eV. This results from a reduced Cu d-band width. Thus, the optical band gap or onset of optical absorption increases in part but not exclusively due to the Moss-Burstein effect. The total energies of the structures are found to increase from monoclinic to hexagonal to cubic to antifluorite. This is consistent with the fact that the simple antifluorite structure is not observed and that the systems change from monoclinic to hexagonal to cubic with increasing temperature, under the assumption that the electronic energy of the system dominates the free energy. We find that Cu(2)S is unstable toward the formation of Cu vacancies even in thermodynamic equilibrium with bulk Cu metal. The experimental data on the band gaps and optical absorption are discussed. We find no evidence for indirect band gaps in the hexagonal materials and argue that the experimental results are consistent with this in spite of previous reports to the contrary. The presence of a second onset of absorption located about 0.5 eV higher than the minimum band gap observed in experiment is explained by a rise in conduction band density of states at this energy in our calculations. The calculated increase in gap with decreasing Cu concentration is in agreement with experimental observations.},

This is the first time that the f-orbital electron-electron interactions in an actinide have been treated by a first-principles method beyond the level of the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or the local-density approximation (LDA) to the density-functional theory (DFT). We show that the QSGW approximation predicts an f-level shift upward of about 0.5 eV with respect to the other metallic s-d states and that there is a significant f-band narrowing when compared to LDA band-structure results. We predict a considerable QSGW enhancement of the linear coefficient of specific heat. Nonetheless, because of the overall low f-electron occupation number in uranium, ground-state properties and the occupied band structure around the Fermi energy are not significantly affected. The correlations predominate in the unoccupied part of the f states. This provides the first formal justification for the success of LDA and GGA calculations in describing the ground-state properties of this material.},

The calculated band gap depends strongly on the anion displacement u, an internal structural parameter that measures lattice distortion. This contrasts with the observed stability of the band gap of CIS solar panels under operating conditions, where a relatively large dispersion of values for u occurs. We solve this apparent paradox considering the coupled effect on the band gap of copper vacancies and lattice distortions. The correct treatment of d electrons in these materials requires going beyond density functional theory, and GW self-consistency is critical to evaluate the quasiparticle gap and the valence band maximum.},

abstract = {We present a new all-electron, augmented-wave implementation of the GW approximation using eigenfunctions generated by a recent variant of the full-potential LMTO method. The dynamically screened Coulomb interaction W is expanded in a mixed basis set which consists of two contributions, local atom-centered functions confined to muffin-tin spheres, and plane waves with the overlap to the local functions projected out. The former can include any of the core states; thus the core and valence states can be treated on an equal footing, Systematic studies of semiconductors and insulators show that the GW fundamental bandgaps consistently fall low in comparison to experiment. Also the quasi-particle (QP) levels differ significantly from other, approximate methods, in particular those that approximate the core with a pseudopotential, or those that include valence states only.

abstract = {Following the usual procedure of the GW approximation (GWA) within the first-principles framework, we calculate the self-energy from eigenfunctions and eigenvalues generated by the local-density approximation. We analyze several possible sources of error in the theory and its implementation, using a recently developed all-electron approach based on the full-potential linear muffin-tin orbital (LMTO) method. First we present some analysis of convergence in some quasiparticle energies with respect to the number of bands, and also their dependence on different basis sets within the LMTO method. We next present a new analysis of core contributions. Then we apply the GWA to a variety of materials systems to test its range of validity. For simple sp semiconductors, GWA always underestimates band gaps. Better agreement with experiment is obtained when the renormalization (Z) factor is not included, and we propose a justification for it. We close with some analysis of difficulties in the usual GWA procedure.},

We present some theoretical discussion concerning the formulation of QSGW, including a prescription for calculating the total energy.

abstract = {Results of theoretical studies of electronic and optical properties of III-V nitride compound semiconductors under pressure are presented. As representatives InN and AIN have been chosen, and for InN the pressure effects on the fundamental gap as well as the role of conduction-band filling are examined. Both the fundamental gap and the electron effective mass increase with pressure, but due to the strong non-parabolicity of the conduction band, the pressure coefficient of the mass decreases with electron concentration. Particular attention is paid to the electronic states in the gap region. The "local-density gap error" is avoided by performing Quasi Particle self-consistent GW calculations, which produce slightly too large gaps. Including in addition the missing electron-hole excitonic states and the gap renormalization due to electron-phonon interaction a gap reduction is obtained. The c-h correlations are deduced from solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation. These are further used to study excitonic states in the gap of AIN under pressure, and for the rocksalt phase a pressure induced delocalized -> localized transition is predicted.

Small empirical corrections were added so as to reproduce experimental band gaps. Our results are in reasonable agreement with previous work, though we observe some discrepancy.

abstract = {Using linear-response density-functional theory, we obtain the magnetic interactions in several iron pnictides. The ground state has been found to be non-collinear in FeSe, with a large continuum of nearly degenerate states lying very close to the magnetic 'striped' structure. The presence of non-collinearity also seems to be a generic feature of iron pnictides when the Fe moment is small. At small R(Fe-Se) the system is itinerant: strong frustration gives rise to an excess of spin entropy, long ranged interactions create incommensurate orderings and strong biquadratic coupling violates the applicability of the Heisenberg model. There is a smooth transition to more localized behavior as R(Fe-Se) increases: stable magnetic orbital order develops which favors long range AFM stripe ordering with strongly anisotropic in-plane exchange couplings. The stabilization of the stripe magnetic order is accompanied by the inversion of the exchange coupling.},

@article{Kurzman2011,
abstract = {PbPdO₂, a ternary compound containing the lone pair active ion Pb²⁺ and the square planar d⁸Pd²⁺ ion, has attracted recent interest because of the suggestion that its electronic structure, calculated within density functional theory using either the local density or the generalized gradient approximation, displays zero-gap behavior. In light of the potential ease of doping magnetic ions in this structure, it has been suggested that the introduction of spin, in conjunction with zero band gap, can result in unusual magnetic ground states and unusual magnetotransport. It is known that most electronic structure calculations do not properly obtain a band gap even for the simple oxide PdO, and instead obtain a metal or a zero-gap semiconductor. Here we present density functional calculations employing a screened hybrid functional which correctly obtain a band gap for the electronic structure of PdO. When employed to calculate the electronic ground state of PbPdO₂, a band gap is again obtained, which is consistent with both the experimental data on this compound, as well as a consideration of valence states and of metal-oxygen connectivity in the crystal structure. We also present comparisons of the absolute positions (relative to the vacuum level) of the conduction band minima and the valence band maxima in $\alpha$-PbO, PdO and PbPdO₂, which suggest ease of p-type doping in PbPdO₂, that has been observed even in nominally pure materials.},

abstract = {The electronic structures of mercury chalcogenides in the zinc-blende structure have been calculated within the LDA, GW (G(0)W(0), "one-shot") and quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approximations, including spin-orbit (SO) coupling. The slight tendency to overestimation of band gaps by QSGW is avoided by using a hybrid scheme (20\% LDA and 80\% QSGW). The details of the GW bands near the top of the valence bands differ significantly from the predictions obtained by calculations within the LDA. The results obtained by G(0)W(0) depend strongly on the starting wave functions and are thus quite different from those obtained from QSGW. Within QSGW, HgS is found to be a semiconductor, with a Gamma(6) s-like conduction-band minimum state above the valence top Gamma(7) and Gamma(8) ("negative" SO splitting). HgSe and HgTe have negative gaps (inverted band structures), but for HgTe the Gamma(7) state is below Gamma(6) due to the large Te SO splitting, in contrast to HgSe where Gamma(6) is below Gamma(7). There appears to be significant differences, in particular for HgSe and HgS, between the ordering of the band-edge states as obtained from experiments and theory.},

abstract = {Different approximations in calculations of electronic quasi-particle states in semiconductors are compared and evaluated with respect to their validity in predictions of optical properties. The quasi-particle self-consistent GW (QSGW) approach yields values of the band gaps which are close to experiments and represents a significant improvement over "single-shot" GW calculations using local density approximation (LDA) start wavefunctions. The QSGW approximation is compared to LDA bands for a wide-gap material (CuAlO(2)) and materials with very small gaps, PbX (X = S, Se, and Te). For wide-gap materials QSGW overestimates the gaps by 0.3-0.8 eV, an error which is ascribed to the omission of "vertex corrections." This is confirmed by calculations of excitonic effects, by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation. The LDA error in predicting the binding energy of the Cu-3d states is examined and the QSGW and LDA + U approximations are compared. For PbX the spin-orbit coupling is included, and it is shown that although LDA gives a reasonable magnitude of the gap at L, only QSGW predicts the correct order of the L(6)(+) and L(6)(-) states and thus the correct sign (negative) of the gap pressure coefficient. The pressure-induced gap closure leads to linear (Dirac-type) band dispersions around the L point. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim},

@article{Liu2012a,
abstract = {The electronic structure and optical absorption properties of the $\beta$-FeSi2(100)/Si(001) interface are investigated by first-principle calculation at high pressure. As the pressure increases, the optical gap decreases sharply, reaches a minimum, and then increases slowly. Structural analysis reveals that the Si(001) slab partially offsets the pressure exerted on the $\beta$-FeSi2 (100) interface, thus downshifting the lowest unoccupied electronic states of the interface and decreasing the optical gap. As the pressure increases further, this offsetting effect weakens and the optical gap increases again gradually. Hence, a high pressure plays an important role in the optical behavior.},

	abstract = {The nonresonant tunneling regime for charge transfer across nanojunctions is critically dependent on the so-called β parameter, governing the exponential decay of the current as the length of the junction increases. For periodic materials, this parameter can be theoretically evaluated by computing the complex band structure {(CBS)—or} evanescent states—of the material forming the tunneling junction. In this work we present the calculation of the {CBS} for organic polymers using a variety of computational schemes, including standard local, semilocal, and hybrid-exchange density functionals, and many-body perturbation theory within the {GW} approximation. We compare the description of localization and β parameters among the adopted methods and with experimental data. We show that local and semilocal density functionals systematically underestimate the β parameter, while hybrid-exchange schemes partially correct for this discrepancy, resulting in a much better agreement with {GW} calculations and experiments. Self-consistency effects and self-energy representation issues of the {GW} corrections are discussed together with the use of Wannier functions to interpolate the electronic band structure.},

The band gap is measured by optical methods, and the Cu vacancy density and anion displacement parameter are determined by neutron scattering. Our data show that the band gap decreases for Cu-poor compositions, and the anion displacement is weakly dependent on the concentration of Cu vacancies. This is in apparent contradiction with ab initio calculations that always predict a larger band gap in presence of Cu vacancies. To shed light on this issue, we studied the overall dependence of the band gap on the anion displacement and on the concentration of Cu vacancies using a self-consistent {GW} approach and hybrid functionals, including a feedback mechanism that was recently proposed. Our calculations illustrate consistently the remarkable stability of the band gap of chalcopyrite semiconductors and explain the experimental observations by a coupled effect of Cu vacancies and lattice distortions within the feedback model.},

	abstract = {In a cubic topological insulator {(TI)}, there is a band inversion whereby the s-like Γ6c conduction band is below the p-like Γ7v+Γ8v valence bands by the “inversion energy” Δi{\textless}0. In {TIs} based on the zinc-blende structure such as {HgTe}, the Fermi energy intersects the degenerate Γ8v state so the insulating gap Eg between occupied and unoccupied bands vanishes. To achieve an insulating gap Eg{\textgreater}0 critical for {TI} applications, one often needs to resort to structural manipulations such as structural symmetry lowering (e.g., {Bi2Se3)}, strain, or quantum confinement. However, these methods have thus far opened an insulating gap of only {\textless}0.1 {eV.} Here we point out that there is an electronic rather than structural way to affect an insulating gap in a {TI:} if one can invert the spin-orbit levels and place Γ8v below Γ7v (“negative spin-orbit splitting”), one can realize band inversion (Δi{\textless}0) with a large insulating gap {(Eg} up to 0.5 {eV).} We outline design principles to create negative spin-orbit splitting: hybridization of d orbitals into p-like states. This general principle is illustrated in the “filled tetrahedral structures” {(FTS)} demonstrating via {GW} and density functional theory {(DFT)} calculations Eg{\textgreater}0 with Δi{\textless}0, albeit in a metastable form of {FTS.}},

It enables us to examine approximations behind the standard local density {approximation+U} and self-interaction corrected approaches. {QSGW} reproduces the experimental occupied 4f levels well, though the unoccupied levels are a little overestimated.

The calculated band gap depends strongly on the anion displacement u, an internal structural parameter that measures lattice distortion. This contrasts with the observed stability of the band gap of {CIS} solar panels under operating conditions, where a relatively large dispersion of values for u occurs. We solve this apparent paradox considering the coupled effect on the band gap of copper vacancies and lattice distortions. The correct treatment of d electrons in these materials requires going beyond density functional theory, and {GW} self-consistency is critical to evaluate the quasiparticle gap and the valence band maximum.},

We show that for closed-shell systems self-consistent {GW} reaches the same final Green's function regardless of the initial reference state. Self-consistency systematically improves ionization energies and total energies of closed-shell systems compared to {G0W0} based on Hartree-Fock and (semi)local density-functional theory. These improvements also translate to the electron density, as exemplified by an improved description of dipole moments, and permit us to assess the quality of ground-state properties such as bond lengths and vibrational frequencies.},
