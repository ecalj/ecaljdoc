TBE 6.1 corrected erroneously permuted hamiltonian blocks 
h_R'L',RL -> h_RL,R'L' in (files tbloch.f and addves.f of) TBE 5.x
and earlier versions.  This has the following consequences:

1.  The spin orbit coupling TBE 5.x was slightly incorrect.

2.  The matrix elements coupling neighbors (i,j) in the ME category was
    in fact (j,i). To make TBE 6.1 input file compatible with 5.x,
    permute (i,j) couplings with (j,i) couplings in category ME.
