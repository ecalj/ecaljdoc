------ Release of v6.14 ----
  Requires SLATSM.43

* Major changes:
  See ChangeLog in separate directories for fuller description of changes.
	
  * Spin-orbit coupling added to programs lmf and lmfgw

  * Programs lmf and lmfgw now can add self-energy sigma to hamiltonian
    for self-consistent GW.  New code for analyzing GW output
    to make RPA total energy.

  * ASA code has proper Kohn-Sham energy functional.

  * External Zeeman field can be added in ASA.

  * Codes lmf and lm parallelized for MPI
    Code lmf can deal with charged systems.

  * Green's function lmgf can run in fully relativistic mode
    (not fully functional)

  * Layer Green's function lmpg modified for proper treatment 
    of potential shifts.  Transport mode works correctly, also in
    noncollinear mode.
