Added CLSTYL to ME category (see rdtbh.f).  Idea is to add more
flexibility to what pairs are associated with a specified rule for
matrix elements.  To invoke, ME has optional CLSTYL, which must
follow memode:

ME  memode [CLSTYL=0 or 1 or 2]  [DECAY0=#]
    i-list j-list | rule1
    i-list j-list | rule2
    ...

CLSTYL=1 uses the original convention for i-list and j-list, namely
a list of class numbers using the usual syntax in mkilst.f, eg
i-list looks like 1,2,7:10

CLSTYL=2 takes any class satisfying an expression involving variables
ic (the class number) and z (the class atomic number), eg
i-list looks like, eg, ic<10&z==6
It this case any of the first ten classes with Z=6 will be included
in i-list.

CLSTYL=3, for unix systems, uses file names with wild cards.  For
each class with name 'nam' a file is created, file 'nam.ext'  You
enter i-list as a class name with wild cards, eg
i-list looks like a*
Any class whose corresponding file the unix shell finds by
expanding the file 'i-list.ext' (in this case all classes beginning
with 'a') are included in the list.


John Klepeis added the capability to handle crystal field terms and
an overlap.  The structure of input for the various kinds of quantities
are essentially the same.  The separator between the list and rule
distinguishes them:

ME
    i-list j-list | rule    for Hamiltonian
    i-list j-list ! rule    for repulsive term
    i-list j-list @ rule    for overlap
    i-list j-list & rule    for crystal field
    i-list j-list % rule    for crystal field-overlap

See lm/testing/ctrl.tbovl for a test case.
