* Major changes:
  See ChangeLog in separate directories for fuller description of changes.
	
	* (W. Lambrecht) optics has nonlinear capability

	* (W. Lambrecht) lmf has LDA+U functional

	* (T. Sandu) lmgf has capability to make screened exchange

	* (A. Chantis) L.S spin-orbit coupling implemented into lmf

	* (M. van Schilfgaarde) Noncollinear magnetism can be orbital-dependent

	* (A. Chantis) Fully relativistic mode in lm, lmgf, lmpg codes

	* (A. T. Paxton) Incorporation of molecules program into package

	* (M. van Schilfgaarde) lmf has extended local orbitals.  Other
   	changes result in slight changes in potential, total energy
	relative to v6.14

	* (M. van Schilfgaarde) implemented floating orbitals
        (envelope functions with no head augmentation sphere)  
          
	* (S. Faleev) Nonequilibrium Green's function implemented in layer
	Green's function
