The following steps should be made to enable MPI with ASA-6.12y.
Tested for RedHat Linux 7.3 with Portland Group compilers.

1. Add the file parrng.f into slatsm directory and to slatsm Makefile.
   This function calculates the range of k-point numbers allotted for
   the process according to its rank.

2. Invoke configure in slatsm:
     env FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc LIBLOC='-lfftw' ./configure

3. Invoke "make init"

4. The following is required because the MPI environment does not
   support calls to getarg(). Edit the fmain.c file as follows:

   a) Remove the lines:
      #if !(LINUXI | LINUXA | LINUXF)
        aargc = argc;
        pargv = argv;
      #endif
   b) Add the line
        MPI_Finalize();
      before exit from main,
        exit (ret_val);
   c) In the nargc_() procedure replace
        #if (LINUXI | LINUXA | LINUXF | LINUX)
          int i,iargc_();
          return(iargc_()+1);
        #else
          return(aargc);
        #endif
      with
        return(aargc);

5. Edit the Make.inc file replacing pgf90 by mpif90 (in two places) and
   pgcc by mpicc. Add -DMPI to CFLAGS

6. Compile the slatsm.a library:
     make all

7. cd to lm-6.12y. Invoke
     env FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc LIBLOC='-lfftw' ./configure
   or
     env FC=pgf90 CC=pgcc LIBLOC='-lfftw' ./configure --enable-nc
   if you need non-collinear extensions.

8. In the lm-6.12y/subs/subs-to-linux_pgi add the following line
     ../startup/ccomp-files MPI .
   after
     ../startup/ccomp-files LINUX_PGI .

9. Copy the modified bndasa.f file to lm-6.12y/subs (and lm-6.12y/nc).

10. Invoke (in lm-6.12y) 
      make init

11. Edit the Make.inc file replacing pgf90 by mpif90 (in two places) and
    pgcc by mpicc. Add -DMPI to CFLAGS (actually, mpicc is not used here).

12. This step should be done if you work in an nfs-shared file system.
    cd to subs. In asaddq.f and secmat.f find 'TMP' in the calls to fopn
    calls and replace by '/tmp/tmp'. Do the same in the call to fadd in
    ../lm.f. At present, all writes and reads to MOMS files in bndasa.f
    have been disabled. If you need it as input for some other program,
    run one iteration with the regular lm code. 

13. Invoke (in subs)
      make all

14. ccomp the lm.f file in lm-6.12y:
      ccomp -dMPI lm.f lm.ff
      mv lm.ff lm.f

15. Remove the line
      call MPI_FINALIZE(ierr)
    from lm-6.12y/lm.f

16. Invoke in lm-6.12y:
      make lm

17. To run the program lm, you have to make copies of str, sdot and atomic
    files for all processes with additional extension "_n" where n runs from
    1 to the total number of processes less 1. For example, if you have
    the ctrl.aaa file with Fe and Fe1 atoms and want to run lm on three
    processors, you have to run lmstr aaa, copy str.aaa to str.aaa_1 and
    str.aaa_2; sdot.aaa to sdot.aaa_1 and sdot.aaa_2; and the same for
    fe.aaa and fe1.aaa. It is OK if you do not have atomic files - the
    program will create as many as needed. However, if you do have
    fe.aaa and fe1.aaa and wish to use them for startup parameters, you
    MUST make appropriate copies or else different processes will get
    different atomic parameters and the calculation will be incorrect. 
    Finally, you SHOULD use BZ METAL=2 or else the program will not work.
    If you change anything in the ctrl file (like the number of k-points),
    destroy all leftover mixm.* and wkp.* files.
