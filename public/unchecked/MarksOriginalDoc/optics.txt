--- Optics package (v6.11) ---

This package enables the computation of the q->0 dielectric response
function epsilon(omega) within the ASA.  It was adapted from a program
written by S. Rashkeev, who in turn adapted it from several other
authors.  Rashkeev also wrote a nonlinear optics code, but it is
only partially completed here.

--- Additions to the input file ---
The optics takes its input from a new category OPTICS:

*category OPTICS

  token
  MODE=    #, where # signifies:
  	   0: make no optics calculations
  	  -1: generate joint density-of-states
  	   1: generate linear eps_2
  	   2: generate second harmonic epsilon
  	      1 and 2 are allowed in combination

  WINDOW=  #1,#2 Energy window over which to calculate epsilon.  It is
           tabulated on a uniform mesh of points in the range #1,#2

  NPTS=    Number of energy points in the window.

  FILBND=  #1[,#2] occupied energy bands from which to calculate
           epsilon using first order perturbation theory.
           #1 = bottom occupied band
           #2 = highest occupied band (defaults to no. electrons)

  EMPBND=  #1[,#2] unoccupied energy bands from which to calculate
           epsilon using first order perturbation theory.
           #1 = bottom unoccupied band
           #2 = highest unoccupied band (defaults to no. bands).

  PART=    if true, enables band-to-band decomposition of epsilon

  CHI2:    parameters for second harmonic generation:
           Not implemented.

  ESCISS=  Scissors operator (energy added to unoccupied levels)
