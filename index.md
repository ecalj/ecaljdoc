features:
  - title: Quasi-particle self-consistent ùòéùòû methods
    details: First-principles electronic structure calculations to determine the best independent particle picture for describing electronic excitations
  - title: Material properties
    details: Linear responses. Wannier and MLO modelling. Spectrum functions, life time due to e-e scattering.
  - title: Easy to use 
    details: ecalj is based on the th PMT method, which is a all electron method with LMTO + LAPW, where we use only < 3Ry cutoff for APW. Automatically applicable to wide range of materials. Read in POSCAR for VASP (converter). Automatic band path. Plot GW band without the Wannier interpolation.
