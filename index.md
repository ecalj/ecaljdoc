features:
  - title: Quasiparticle self-consistent ùòéùòû methods (QSGW)
    details: In addition to LDA/GGA and LDA+U, we can perform QSGW to describe electronic excitations.<BR>  1. The spin-orbit coupling can be included for given direction of spins (currently only colinear). <BR> 2. We can apply antiferro ordering. Thus computationally efficient and stable.<BR>3. We can apply QSGW even to magnetic metallic systems.<BR>4. With four GPU, we handled supercells containing 40 atoms, such as GaSb/InAs superlattice.<BR>5.Main part of codes is written in object-oriented module coding in fortran. <BR> (Total energy in QSGW is not yet implemented. Atomic positions can not be relaxed in QSGW.)<BR>---<BR>
  - title: Material properties on top of QSGW 
    details: Until now, we published <BR> 1. Dielectric functions (even the intra band contribution at finite q for metallic systems)<BR>2. Spin fluctuations<BR>3. Impact inonization rate <BR>4. Spectrum functions of the Green's function<BR>---<BR>In addition, we are developing new modeling 'MLO' replacing maxloc Wannier. Other linear responses such as AHC is under construction.
  - title: Easy to use 
    details: ecalj is based on the th PMT = LMTO+LAPW, where we use only ~ 3Ry cutoff for APWs. Such APWs dissolve the problems of the LMTO method.<BR>---<BR>1. We do not set parameters by hands. Thus we can generate QSGW database.<BR>  2.We can read POSCAR in VASP. <BR>3. Automatic band path and BZ (using seekpath and spglib). Plot GW band structures without the Wannier interpolations. Some other utilities included.
