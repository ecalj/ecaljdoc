features:
  - title: Quasi-particle self-consistent ùòéùòû methods (QSGW)
    details: First-principles electronic structure calculations to determine the best independent particle picture for describing electronic excitations
  - title: Material properties on top of QSGW 
    details: Linear responses. Maxloc Wannier modeling. In addition new modeling MLO is going to be implemented. Spectrum functions, life time due to e-e scattering.
  - title: Easy to use 
    details: ecalj is based on the th PMT method, which is an all electron method with LMTO + LAPW, where we use only ~ 3Ry cutoff for APW. Automatically applicable to wide range of materials. POSCAR in the VASP format can be readable. Automatic band path. Plot GW band structures without the Wannier interpolation.
